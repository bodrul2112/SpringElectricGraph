SpringElectricGraph
====
A forced based algorithm to display a connected graph. Using Java and AWT.

- Aims
	- Create an abstraction to allow the code to be ported pretty easily from one language to another
	- Add a nice set of examples that demonstrate the possible uses of a force based graph
	- Add controls to modify the parameters of the force calculation
	- Update the Java Animation Template project with the abstractions I find useful here
