1) Refactor changes from Android force graph back into this project
2) Abstract away the mouse/touch controls
3) Abstract away drawing to graphics2D/canvas
4) Abstract away set up


Abstract Setup -> handler -> Abstract ForceGraph -> handler -> AbstractRenderer -> handler

Effectively I should be able to manually port the code from one language to another pretty easily.
